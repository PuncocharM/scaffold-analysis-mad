CF values greater than 1 are characterized by a lower affinity for the progesterone receptor, and CF values of less than 1 are characterized by higher affinity.","assay format","CHEMBL208","Progesterone receptor","Homo sapiens","SINGLE PROTEIN","CHEMBL3639070","BindingDB Database","4","0","366.5","20.09","0.37","3.05","16.98","4.31","","","","","","9606","BAO_0000019","","","","","C[C@]12CCC(=O)C=C1[C@@H]3C[C@@H]3[C@@H]4[C@@H]2CC[C@@]5(C)[C@H]4[C@@H]6C[C@@H]6[C@@]57CCC(=O)O7","","","2015","37","UO_0000065","False"
