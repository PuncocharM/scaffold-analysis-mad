The cells are then plated in 6-well dishes at a density of 2×10^5 cells per well in phenol-red free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal-dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum. CV-1 cells are transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfections containing 1.5 μg of reporter plasmid (containing ERE-tk-luciferase containing a single ERE cloned upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter and luciferase gene) and 0.5 μg of either ERα or ERβ expression vector (containing CMV-ERα or CMV-ERβ full length coding sequence respectively). The next day, cells receive no treatment (controls) or are treated with estradiol alone (1 nM) or estradiol plus a compound of the invention (at varying concentrations). After 16-24 hours, cells are harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. At the outset, cell monolayers are washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 15 minutes in 250 μl of 1× cell culture lysis reagent (Promega, Madison, Wis.). Cell extracts are transferred to a fresh tube and assayed using the luciferase assay system (Promega). For each assay, 10 μl of extract is diluted with 90 μl of 1× cell culture lysis reagent. Luminescence is read using an AutoLumat LB953 luminometer.","cell-based format","CHEMBL242","Estrogen receptor beta","Homo sapiens","SINGLE PROTEIN","CHEMBL3886867","BindingDB Database","0","0","316.44","22.43","0.42","3.3","14.28","3.8","Homo sapiens","","","CV-1","","9606","BAO_0000219","","","","","COC[C@@H]1CC2C(CC[C@]3(C)[C@@H](O)CCC23)c4ccc(O)cc14","","","2016","37","UO_0000065","False"

The cells are then plated in 6-well dishes at a density of 2×10^5 cells per well in phenol-red free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal-dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum. CV-1 cells are transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfections containing 1.5 μg of reporter plasmid (containing ERE-tk-luciferase containing a single ERE cloned upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter and luciferase gene) and 0.5 μg of either ERα or ERβ expression vector (containing CMV-ERα or CMV-ERβ full length coding sequence respectively). The next day, cells receive no treatment (controls) or are treated with estradiol alone (1 nM) or estradiol plus a compound of the invention (at varying concentrations). After 16-24 hours, cells are harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. At the outset, cell monolayers are washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 15 minutes in 250 μl of 1× cell culture lysis reagent (Promega, Madison, Wis.). Cell extracts are transferred to a fresh tube and assayed using the luciferase assay system (Promega). For each assay, 10 μl of extract is diluted with 90 μl of 1× cell culture lysis reagent. Luminescence is read using an AutoLumat LB953 luminometer.","cell-based format","CHEMBL242","Estrogen receptor beta","Homo sapiens","SINGLE PROTEIN","CHEMBL3886867","BindingDB Database","0","0","302.41","25.39","0.48","4.27","15.45","3.41","Homo sapiens","","","CV-1","","9606","BAO_0000219","","","","","COC[C@@H]1C[C@H]2[C@@H]3CCC(O)C3CC[C@@H]2c4ccc(O)cc14","","","2016","37","UO_0000065","False"

The cells are then plated in 6-well dishes at a density of 2×10^5 cells per well in phenol-red free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal-dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum. CV-1 cells are transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfections containing 1.5 μg of reporter plasmid (containing ERE-tk-luciferase containing a single ERE cloned upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter and luciferase gene) and 0.5 μg of either ERα or ERβ expression vector (containing CMV-ERα or CMV-ERβ full length coding sequence respectively). The next day, cells receive no treatment (controls) or are treated with estradiol alone (1 nM) or estradiol plus a compound of the invention (at varying concentrations). After 16-24 hours, cells are harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. At the outset, cell monolayers are washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 15 minutes in 250 μl of 1× cell culture lysis reagent (Promega, Madison, Wis.). Cell extracts are transferred to a fresh tube and assayed using the luciferase assay system (Promega). For each assay, 10 μl of extract is diluted with 90 μl of 1× cell culture lysis reagent. Luminescence is read using an AutoLumat LB953 luminometer.","cell-based format","CHEMBL242","Estrogen receptor beta","Homo sapiens","SINGLE PROTEIN","CHEMBL3886867","BindingDB Database","4","0","272.39","32.19","0.6","5.16","21.67","3.61","Homo sapiens","","","CV-1","","9606","BAO_0000219","","","","","C[C@]12CC[C@H]3[C@@H](CCc4cc(O)ccc34)[C@@H]1CC[C@@H]2O","","","2016","37","UO_0000065","False"
