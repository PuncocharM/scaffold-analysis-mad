A fluorescent labeled GR ligand is used as a fluorescent tracer and test compounds compete with the fluorescent tracer for GR binding. The change in polarization value in the presence of test compounds is due to binding of test compounds to GR and is used to determine IC50 and relative binding affinity of test compounds for GR.","single protein format","CHEMBL2034","Glucocorticoid receptor","Homo sapiens","SINGLE PROTEIN","CHEMBL3638885","BindingDB Database","0","2","594.67","10.17","0.19","-1.93","7.8","7.98","","","","","","9606","BAO_0000357","","","","","CC(C)COC(=O)O[C@@]1(CC[C@]2(Cc3ccccc3)[C@H](CCc4cc(ccc24)C(=O)Nc5cccnc5C)C1)C(F)(F)F","","","2014","37","UO_0000065","False"

A fluorescent labeled GR ligand is used as a fluorescent tracer and test compounds compete with the fluorescent tracer for GR binding.
