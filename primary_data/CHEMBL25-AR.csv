Urol. 17: 16-23, 1979), which express the human androgen receptor stably and recombinantly (full length, wild-type form, see Swiss-Prot Acc. No. P10275, Entry Version 159, Sequence Version 2). In addition, these PC3 cells contain a stably integrated reporter gene plasmid, which is based on the commercially available plasmid pGL4.14 (#E6691, Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA) and contains the luciferase gene from the American firefly (Photinus pyralis) under the control of the MMTV promoter (Cato et al., EMBO J. 6: 363-368, 1987). These cells were propagated in routine cell culture at 37° C. and 5% CO2 in a medium containing 90% RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany), 100 U penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 4 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories GmbH, Cölbe, Germany), 600 μg/ml Geneticin (G418-sulphate, Invitrogen) and 10 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma Aldrich GmbH, Germany). For carrying out the transactivation assays, approx. 1000 cells per well were plated out in a 384-well cell culture plate in a medium that contained activated charcoal-treated calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories) at a concentration of 5% (v/v). The test substances were added in a concentration series from 5.12×10^−12 to 1×10^−5 M in the presence of 1×10^−1° R1881 (methyltrienolone). The test plates were incubated overnight at 37° C. and 5% CO2.

Urol. 17: 16-23, 1979), which express the human androgen receptor stably and recombinantly (full length, wild-type form, see Swiss-Prot Acc. No. P10275, Entry Version 159, Sequence Version 2). In addition, these PC3 cells contain a stably integrated reporter gene plasmid, which is based on the commercially available plasmid pGL4.14 (#E6691, Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA) and contains the luciferase gene from the American firefly (Photinus pyralis) under the control of the MMTV promoter (Cato et al., EMBO J. 6: 363-368, 1987). These cells were propagated in routine cell culture at 37° C. and 5% CO2 in a medium containing 90% RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany), 100 U penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 4 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories GmbH, Cölbe, Germany), 600 μg/ml Geneticin (G418-sulphate, Invitrogen) and 10 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma Aldrich GmbH, Germany). For carrying out the transactivation assays, approx. 1000 cells per well were plated out in a 384-well cell culture plate in a medium that contained activated charcoal-treated calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories) at a concentration of 5% (v/v). The test substances were added in a concentration series from 5.12×10^−12 to 1×10^−5 M in the presence of 1×10^−1° R1881 (methyltrienolone). The test plates were incubated overnight at 37° C. and 5% CO2. After 16 hours, 15 μl of Steady Glo Lysis and Detection reagent (E2550, Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA) was added per well and the luminescence was read in a Topcount Luminometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Mass., USA) for 4 seconds per well. The luminescence values obtained were normalized, wherein 100% corresponded to the effect of the unstimulated control (without R1881), and 0% corresponded to the effect of the stimulated control (R1881 plus DMSO instead of test substance).","cell-based format","CHEMBL1871","Androgen Receptor","Homo sapiens","SINGLE PROTEIN","CHEMBL3886907","BindingDB Database","0","0","450.34","14.62","0.31","1.59","8.78","4.99","","","","PC-3","","9606","BAO_0000219","","","","","Brc1cccc2c(O[C@@H]3CC[C@H](CC3)NC(=O)c4ccc(cc4)C#N)ccnc12","","","2016","37","UO_0000065","False"

CF values greater than 1 are characterized by a lower affinity for the progesterone receptor, and CF values of less than 1 are characterized by higher affinity.

In addition, these PC3 cells contain a stably integrated reporter gene plasmid, which is based on the commercially available plasmid pGL4.14 (#E6691, Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA) and contains the luciferase gene from the American firefly (Photinus pyralis) under the control of the MMTV promoter (Cato et al., EMBO J. 6: 363-368, 1987). These cells were propagated in routine cell culture at 37° C. and 5% CO2 in a medium containing 90% RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany), 100 U penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 4 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories GmbH, Cölbe, Germany), 600 μg/ml Geneticin (G418-sulphate, Invitrogen) and 10 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma Aldrich GmbH, Germany). For carrying out the transactivation assays, approx. 1000 cells per well were plated out in a 384-well cell culture plate in a medium that contained activated charcoal-treated calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories) at a concentration of 5% (v/v). The test substances were added in a concentration series from 5.12×10^−12 to 1×10^−5 M in the presence of 1×10^−1° R1881 (methyltrienolone). The test plates were incubated overnight at 37° C. and 5% CO2. After 16 hours, 15 μl of Steady Glo Lysis and Detection reagent (E2550, Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA) was added per well and the luminescence was read in a Topcount Luminometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Mass., USA) for 4 seconds per well. The luminescence values obtained were normalized, wherein 100% corresponded to the effect of the unstimulated control (without R1881), and 0% corresponded to the effect of the stimulated control (R1881 plus DMSO instead of test substance).","cell-based format","CHEMBL1871","Androgen Receptor","Homo sapiens","SINGLE PROTEIN","CHEMBL3886907","BindingDB Database","0","0","430.3","17.89","0.39","3.29","9.97","4.41","","","","PC-3","","9606","BAO_0000219","","","","","Cc1onc(c1)C(=O)N[C@@H]2CC[C@H](CC2)Oc3ccnc4c(Br)cccc34","","","2016","37","UO_0000065","False"

For carrying out the transactivation assays, approx. 1000 cells per well were plated out in a 384-well cell culture plate in a medium that contained activated charcoal-treated calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories) at a concentration of 5% (v/v). The test substances were added in a concentration series from 5.12×10^−12 to 1×10^−5 M in the presence of 1×10^−1° R1881 (methyltrienolone).

The assay was performed as specified by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Madison, Wis.).

Urol. 17: 16-23, 1979), which express the human androgen receptor stably and recombinantly (full length, wild-type form, see Swiss-Prot Acc. No. P10275, Entry Version 159, Sequence Version 2). In addition, these PC3 cells contain a stably integrated reporter gene plasmid, which is based on the commercially available plasmid pGL4.14 (#E6691, Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA) and contains the luciferase gene from the American firefly (Photinus pyralis) under the control of the MMTV promoter (Cato et al., EMBO J. 6: 363-368, 1987). These cells were propagated in routine cell culture at 37° C. and 5% CO2 in a medium containing 90% RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany), 100 U penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 4 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories GmbH, Cölbe, Germany), 600 μg/ml Geneticin (G418-sulphate, Invitrogen) and 10 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma Aldrich GmbH, Germany). For carrying out the transactivation assays, approx. 1000 cells per well were plated out in a 384-well cell culture plate in a medium that contained activated charcoal-treated calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories) at a concentration of 5% (v/v). The test substances were added in a concentration series from 5.12×10^−12 to 1×10^−5 M in the presence of 1×10^−1° R1881 (methyltrienolone). The test plates were incubated overnight at 37° C. and 5% CO2. After 16 hours, 15 μl of Steady Glo Lysis and Detection reagent (E2550, Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA) was added per well and the luminescence was read in a Topcount Luminometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Mass., USA) for 4 seconds per well. The luminescence values obtained were normalized, wherein 100% corresponded to the effect of the unstimulated control (without R1881), and 0% corresponded to the effect of the stimulated control (R1881 plus DMSO instead of test substance).","cell-based format","CHEMBL1871","Androgen Receptor","Homo sapiens","SINGLE PROTEIN","CHEMBL3886907","BindingDB Database","0","1","423.88","17.02","0.33","2.19","9.62","5.02","","","","PC-3","","9606","BAO_0000219","","","","","Fc1cc(ccc1Cl)C(=O)N[C@@H]2CC[C@H](CC2)Oc3ccnc4c(cccc34)C#N","","","2016","37","UO_0000065","False"

For carrying out the transactivation assays, approx. 1000 cells per well were plated out in a 384-well cell culture plate in a medium that contained activated charcoal-treated calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories) at a concentration of 5% (v/v). The test substances were added in a concentration series from 5.12×10^−12 to 1×10^−5 M in the presence of 1×10^−1° R1881 (methyltrienolone).

The luminescence values obtained were normalized, wherein 100% corresponded to the effect of the unstimulated control (without R1881), and 0% corresponded to the effect of the stimulated control (R1881 plus DMSO instead of test substance).","cell-based format","CHEMBL1871","Androgen Receptor","Homo sapiens","SINGLE PROTEIN","CHEMBL3886907","BindingDB Database","0","0","378.45","17.74","0.33","1.97","13.1","4.74","","","","PC-3","","9606","BAO_0000219","","","","","Fc1cccc(c1)C(=O)NC[C@@H]2CC[C@H](CC2)Oc3ccnc4ccccc34","","","2016","37","UO_0000065","False"

Urol. 17: 16-23, 1979), which express the human androgen receptor stably and recombinantly (full length, wild-type form, see Swiss-Prot Acc. No. P10275, Entry Version 159, Sequence Version 2). In addition, these PC3 cells contain a stably integrated reporter gene plasmid, which is based on the commercially available plasmid pGL4.14 (#E6691, Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA) and contains the luciferase gene from the American firefly (Photinus pyralis) under the control of the MMTV promoter (Cato et al., EMBO J. 6: 363-368, 1987).

Urol. 17: 16-23, 1979), which express the human androgen receptor stably and recombinantly (full length, wild-type form, see Swiss-Prot Acc. No. P10275, Entry Version 159, Sequence Version 2). In addition, these PC3 cells contain a stably integrated reporter gene plasmid, which is based on the commercially available plasmid pGL4.14 (#E6691, Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA) and contains the luciferase gene from the American firefly (Photinus pyralis) under the control of the MMTV promoter (Cato et al., EMBO J. 6: 363-368, 1987). These cells were propagated in routine cell culture at 37° C. and 5% CO2 in a medium containing 90% RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany), 100 U penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 4 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories GmbH, Cölbe, Germany), 600 μg/ml Geneticin (G418-sulphate, Invitrogen) and 10 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma Aldrich GmbH, Germany). For carrying out the transactivation assays, approx. 1000 cells per well were plated out in a 384-well cell culture plate in a medium that contained activated charcoal-treated calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories) at a concentration of 5% (v/v). The test substances were added in a concentration series from 5.12×10^−12 to 1×10^−5 M in the presence of 1×10^−1° R1881 (methyltrienolone). The test plates were incubated overnight at 37° C. and 5% CO2. After 16 hours, 15 μl of Steady Glo Lysis and Detection reagent (E2550, Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA) was added per well and the luminescence was read in a Topcount Luminometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Mass., USA) for 4 seconds per well. The luminescence values obtained were normalized, wherein 100% corresponded to the effect of the unstimulated control (without R1881), and 0% corresponded to the effect of the stimulated control (R1881 plus DMSO instead of test substance).","cell-based format","CHEMBL1871","Androgen Receptor","Homo sapiens","SINGLE PROTEIN","CHEMBL3886907","BindingDB Database","0","0","376.42","20.57","0.38","4.22","7.67","3.52","","","","PC-3","","9606","BAO_0000219","","","","","Cc1onc(c1)C(=O)N[C@@H]2CC[C@H](CC2)Oc3ccnc4c(cccc34)C#N","","","2016","37","UO_0000065","False"
