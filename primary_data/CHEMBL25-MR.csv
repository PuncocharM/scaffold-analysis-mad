The assay is performed in 384-well, low volume NBS black plates (Corning #3676) in assay buffer consisting of 10 mM TES, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, 20 mM Sodium molybdate, 1.5 mM EDTA, 0.04% CHAPS, 10% Glycerol and 1 mM DTT. Full Length human mineralocorticoid receptor (hMR) present in a baculovirus infected insect cell lysate is diluted 2 fold in assay buffer and 10 μL of this dilution is added to the assay plate. Blank wells receive 10 μL of the diluted MR lysate containing 3 μM Dexamethasone. 2 μL diluted test compound is transferred to the assay plate for a final starting top concentration of 10 μM in 1% DMSO. The reaction is started by adding 3 μL of 25 nM probe in assay buffer for a final assay concentration of 5 nM.","assay format","CHEMBL1994","Mineralocorticoid receptor","Homo sapiens","SINGLE PROTEIN","CHEMBL3638806","BindingDB Database","0","0","300.34","18.54","0.35","2.52","7.82","3.05","Homo sapiens","","","","","9606","BAO_0000019","","","","","NC(=O)Nc1cc(ccn1)N2CCCC2c3ccc(F)cc3","","","2014","37","UO_0000065","False"

CF values greater than 1 are characterized by a lower affinity for the progesterone receptor, and CF values of less than 1 are characterized by higher affinity.

The assay is performed in 384-well, low volume NBS black plates (Corning #3676) in assay buffer consisting of 10 mM TES, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, 20 mM Sodium molybdate, 1.5 mM EDTA, 0.04% CHAPS, 10% Glycerol and 1 mM DTT. Full Length human mineralocorticoid receptor (hMR) present in a baculovirus infected insect cell lysate is diluted 2 fold in assay buffer and 10 μL of this dilution is added to the assay plate. Blank wells receive 10 μL of the diluted MR lysate containing 3 μM Dexamethasone. 2 μL diluted test compound is transferred to the assay plate for a final starting top concentration of 10 μM in 1% DMSO. The reaction is started by adding 3 μL of 25 nM probe in assay buffer for a final assay concentration of 5 nM.","assay format","CHEMBL1994","Mineralocorticoid receptor","Homo sapiens","SINGLE PROTEIN","CHEMBL3638806","BindingDB Database","0","0","271.32","19.05","0.35","3.15","5.86","2.02","Homo sapiens","","","","","9606","BAO_0000019","","","","","CC(O)(Cc1ccnc(NC(=O)N)c1)c2ccccc2","","","2014","37","UO_0000065","False"

CF values greater than 1 are characterized by a lower affinity for the progesterone receptor, and CF values of less than 1 are characterized by higher affinity.

The test was carried out as test above, with the following modifications: cytosol from mineralocorticoid receptor-expressing insect cells (Hi5) was used, and the reference substance was 3H-aldosterone.","assay format","CHEMBL1994","Mineralocorticoid receptor","Homo sapiens","SINGLE PROTEIN","CHEMBL3638672","BindingDB Database","0","0","366.5","23.14","0.43","4.17","19.56","4.31","Homo sapiens","","","","","9606","BAO_0000019","","","","","C[C@@]12CCC(=O)C=C1[C@H]3C[C@H]3[C@H]4[C@H]2CC[C@]5(C)[C@@H]4[C@H]6C[C@H]6[C@]57CCC(=O)O7","","","2015","37","UO_0000065","False"

The assay is performed in 384-well, low volume NBS black plates (Corning #3676) in assay buffer consisting of 10 mM TES, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, 20 mM Sodium molybdate, 1.5 mM EDTA, 0.04% CHAPS, 10% Glycerol and 1 mM DTT. Full Length human mineralocorticoid receptor (hMR) present in a baculovirus infected insect cell lysate is diluted 2 fold in assay buffer and 10 μL of this dilution is added to the assay plate. Blank wells receive 10 μL of the diluted MR lysate containing 3 μM Dexamethasone. 2 μL diluted test compound is transferred to the assay plate for a final starting top concentration of 10 μM in 1% DMSO.

Compounds were tested in a 7 (Test A1) or 10 (Test A2) concentration response curve ranging from 10 nM to 10 μM (Test A1) or 1 nM to 37 μM (Test A2). Compounds were spotted at the bottom of a well of a 384-well PE Opti-Plate to yield final DMSO concentrations in the assay of 2%. Pre-made MBP-MR/P23 lysate: 3H-aldosterone mix (final assay concentration 7 μg/mL MBP-MR LBD/P23 lysate; 5 nM aldosterone) was added onto the top of the spotted compound and preincubated for 1 h at RT. After 1 h an equal volume anti-rabbit SPA beads coupled with rabbit anti-MBP were added to the assay mixture and incubated for 3 hrs at rt.

Compounds were tested in a 7 (Test A1) or 10 (Test A2) concentration response curve ranging from 10 nM to 10 μM (Test A1) or 1 nM to 37 μM (Test A2). Compounds were spotted at the bottom of a well of a 384-well PE Opti-Plate to yield final DMSO concentrations in the assay of 2%. Pre-made MBP-MR/P23 lysate: 3H-aldosterone mix (final assay concentration 7 μg/mL MBP-MR LBD/P23 lysate; 5 nM aldosterone) was added onto the top of the spotted compound and preincubated for 1 h at RT. After 1 h an equal volume anti-rabbit Imaging beads coupled with rabbit anti-MBP were added to the assay mixture and incubated for >8 h at rt. The inhibition of the scintillation signal by displacement of the bound 3H-aldosterone by test compounds is measured by scintillation counting using a CCD camera detection using a LEADseeker (PerkinElmer).","assay format","CHEMBL1994","Mineralocorticoid receptor","Homo sapiens","SINGLE PROTEIN","CHEMBL3886822","BindingDB Database","0","0","399.38","15.35","0.29","4.43","6.32","1.7","","","","","","9606","BAO_0000019","","","","","CNC(=O)CC1COc2cc(F)ccc2N1C(=O)c3ccc4OCC(=O)Nc4c3","","","2016","37","UO_0000065","False"

Compounds were tested in a 7 (Test A1) or 10 (Test A2) concentration response curve ranging from 10 nM to 10 μM (Test A1) or 1 nM to 37 μM (Test A2). Compounds were spotted at the bottom of a well of a 384-well PE Opti-Plate to yield final DMSO concentrations in the assay of 2%. Pre-made MBP-MR/P23 lysate: 3H-aldosterone mix (final assay concentration 7 μg/mL MBP-MR LBD/P23 lysate; 5 nM aldosterone) was added onto the top of the spotted compound and preincubated for 1 h at RT. After 1 h an equal volume anti-rabbit SPA beads coupled with rabbit anti-MBP were added to the assay mixture and incubated for 3 hrs at rt. The inhibition of the scintillation signal by displacement of the bound 3H-aldosterone by test compounds is measured by scintillation counting using a Microbeta Trilux (Wallac).","assay format","CHEMBL1994","Mineralocorticoid receptor","Homo sapiens","SINGLE PROTEIN","CHEMBL3886822","BindingDB Database","0","0","415.83","17.04","0.33","4.88","7.31","2.21","","","","","","9606","BAO_0000019","","","","","CNC(=O)CC1COc2cc(Cl)ccc2N1C(=O)c3ccc4OCC(=O)Nc4c3","","","2016","37","UO_0000065","False"

If a compound has an affinity corresponding to progesterone, this corresponds to a competition factor (CF) of 1. CF values greater than 1 are characterized by a lower affinity for the progesterone receptor, and CF values of less than 1 are characterized by higher affinity. The test was carried out as test above, with the following modifications: cytosol from mineralocorticoid receptor-expressing insect cells (Hi5) was used, and the reference substance was 3H-aldosterone.","assay format","CHEMBL1994","Mineralocorticoid receptor","Homo sapiens","SINGLE PROTEIN","CHEMBL3638672","BindingDB Database","0","1","340.51","19.11","0.36","1.42","24.75","5.09","Homo sapiens","","","","","9606","BAO_0000019","","","","","CC[C@@H]1CC2=CC(=O)CC[C@@H]2[C@H]3CC[C@@]4(C)[C@@H](CC[C@]45OCC=C5)[C@H]13","","","2015","37","UO_0000065","False"
